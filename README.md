### How it works
 
Why does flight delay make us angry and early arrival not happy? This question was answered by scientists from the University of California at San Diego and the University of Chicago. They studied the test subjects' reactions in three situations: when a promise is kept, when it is broken, when the result exceeds all expectations. The response to an unrealized promise was predictable, and all respondents who faced it felt frustrated and deceived. Surprisingly, however, none of the test subjects were happy when the promise was fulfilled earlier or better than expected.

Scientists believe that the results of the study are fair not only in the case of promises made to each other by people, but also in the case of guarantees that companies give to consumers. For example, if Amazon.com promised to deliver a book in 4 days and delivered it in 3, the buyer is unlikely to be happy. So if you want to exceed the expectations of a friend or customer, think about whether it is worth your efforts - they are unlikely to be appreciated.

- Professor of behavioral psychology at the University of Chicago
 
"Our research makes us think about how we distribute our forces. When you are confident that you are able to answer for your words, it is better to make a promise out loud. If you manage to keep your promise, your boss or your clients will be immensely happy. But if you are not sure that you are able to fulfill a promise, or if you think that you can exceed all expectations, it is better not to promise anything and just to surprise others.

# Lifehak: 72 hours rule

- Tip 
- Try to implement your ideas no longer than 72 hours (or 3 days). This is the optimal amount of time for the first step towards a long-term goal.

### How it works
 
Bodo Sch√§fer, a German business consultant and orator, says that if you postpone your plans for more than 72 hours, the probability that the task will remain just an intention grows to 85%. When we start to execute the plan right away, we signal to the brain that the goal is important to us, and when we successfully complete the first steps - even such elementary steps as searching for information or sending e-mails - we program ourselves for success. Procrustration, on the other hand, undermines our faith in ourselves and reduces the chances that the plan will come true.

According to the famous first law of British historian Cyril Parkinson, "the work fills the time allocated to it," that is, the task adds to the importance and complexity commensurate with the time allocated to its implementation. It turns out that by allocating a week to a task that can be accomplished in two hours, we ourselves attach more importance to it and convince ourselves of its complexity. This law explains the magic of the deadline: the specific time frame set for the task makes us work more efficiently.

"To implement any task, define three steps that bring it closer. Create a sequence of simple, concrete actions for today, tomorrow (finish before 23:00), and the day after tomorrow (finish again before 23:00). Decide on three steps for each of the objectives, and perform three actions from the "Do it now" column. Take them and do them immediately. Of course, the steps should be simple so that you can control them in five minutes or even faster. <...> "Tomorrow" means "never". Whatever the task, take the first step now!
